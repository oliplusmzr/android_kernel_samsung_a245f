config MTK_ZRAM_ENGINE
	tristate "MTK zram engine feature"
	help
	  MTK proprietary compression engine, which is highly integrated with
	  ZRAM to provide fast and light-loading compression tasks.
	  This is used for the improvement of sw compression over some scenarios.
	  If you are not sure about whether to enable it or not, please set n.

	depends on MTK_ZRAM_ENGINE && MTK_KCOMPRESSD
	select ZSMALLOC
	help
	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/block/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory itself.
	  These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides good amounts of
	  memory savings.
	  If you are not sure about whether to enable it or not, please set n.

config ZRAM_ENGINE_COMP_FIFO_BITS
	int "The entry bits of ZRAM ENGINE Compression FIFOs (8-11)"
	range 8 11
	default "11"
	help
	  This will create a fifo with depth of 2^8 ~ 2^11.

config ZRAM_ENGINE_DECOMP_FIFO_BITS
	int "The entry bits of ZRAM ENGINE Decompression FIFOs (3-7)"
	range 3 7
	default "7"
	help
	  This will create per-cpu fifos with depth of 2^3 ~ 2^7 for
	  decompression.

config HWCOMP_SUPPORT_NO_DST_COPY
	bool "No extra SW copy to store HW compressed data"
	default y
	help
	  Original zram uses zsmalloc to store compressed data. The flow is to compress
	  SRC page and then copy the compressed data to zsmalloc. Turn on this option will
	  use slab memory to store compressed data directly without the SW copy.
